# Half_Pathway_DeepMedic
This is a simple CNN network implement for brain tumor segmentation, and don't have any data augmentation and the state-of-art tricks for training. So the performance may be not good for your study, you can change our code freely for your need on sutdy but not for commercial use.
This repo reimplements the half pathway DeepMedic architecture. The dataet.py contains dataset class for our brain tumor dataset. The Half_Pathway_DeepMedic.ipynb contains all the code for brain tumor segmentation including training and testing. The aichitecture of our CNN achitecture is half pathway DeepMedic.
